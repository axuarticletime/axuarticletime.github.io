    <p><strong>Websites:</strong></p>
    <p>Websites are part of our daily life ‚Äî from social media to search engines. Even Google itself is a website, visited by billions every day. The growth of websites has been fueled by advancements in technology, especially Artificial Intelligence (AI), which has revolutionized how we search, create, and communicate.</p>
    <p>Today, tasks that once took hours can now be completed in minutes. Tools like Canva, ChatGPT, and website builders make it possible to create professional designs and sites without any coding knowledge. While this is convenient, there‚Äôs a downside ‚Äî over-reliance on AI can make us mentally lazy. For example, simple math that we once did in our heads is now handled by AI tools without much thought.</p>

    <h2>Digital Life</h2>
    <p>‚ÄúDigital life‚Äù refers to the integration of digital technology into our everyday living. From wearable devices to futuristic inventions, many ideas once considered dreams are now realities. Robots, AI assistants, and smart devices have transformed industries ‚Äî but they also raise questions about what makes human experience unique, such as emotions and personal connection.</p>

    <h2>Drawbacks</h2>
    <p>Technology makes life easier, but it also creates dependency. Mobile phones and social media consume so much of our attention that real-life interaction suffers. Students rely heavily on laptops instead of books, which may lead to health issues such as poor eyesight. Overuse of digital tools can also erode critical thinking and problem-solving skills.</p>
    <p>Ultimately, technology itself isn‚Äôt good or bad ‚Äî it‚Äôs how we use it. Being mindful of our digital habits, staying safe online, and guiding children toward responsible internet use are crucial steps toward a healthier digital life.</p>
