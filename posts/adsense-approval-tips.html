    <p>Yep, the same issue many bloggers are facing nowadays. But the reason is very simple which they ignore and the real reason.</p>

    <p>So let’s get going and discuss these simple issues which have become a headache for many bloggers.</p>

    <h2>1. Domain and Hosting</h2>
    <p>Google AdSense requires a solid domain and hosting, which has a good domain age that gives them trust value.<br />
    In short, it doesn’t mean you buy a domain today and tomorrow you apply for AdSense — which is wrong.<br />
    So keep it in mind patience is everything, it may take you 2 years or 5 months for approval depending on your content.<br />
    If you use a custom built-in domain website like Blogger or free WordPress they don’t get monetized because Blogger has one issue which is unresolvable and free WordPress doesn’t let you monetize.<br />
    I have tried 1 year on all these so don’t waste your time.</p>

    <h2>2. Traffic</h2>
    <p>Even if you have a good website, good content but if you don’t have traffic all hard work is of no use because<br />
    AdSense doesn’t require any specific visits number but it may be needed for your earnings and the easy way is to share it on your social media accounts like Facebook, Pinterest, Quora, Twitter — they are popular for gaining views.</p>

    <h2>3. Patience</h2>
    <p>You may receive rejections from AdSense but stay patient and fix the problems, because it takes time for everything.<br />
    So wait and give it some time.</p>

    <h2>Drawback</h2>
    <p>I know many of you want to create a website but don’t have money so listen — AdSense doesn’t require a specific paid domain, shock right?<br />
    Yeah you will, because many sites offer a built-in custom domain which needs some hard work, but they are ready to go for AdSense without spending a dime.<br />
    But remember don’t think the results are 100 percent guaranteed.<br />
    So patience and relax — things are hard but it will work in your favor.<br />
    Let’s follow me for more tips.</p>
