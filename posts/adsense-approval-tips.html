    <p>So, you thought of making some extra bucks online but ended up discouraged because of AdSense’s rejection emails? You’re not alone — many bloggers face the same problem. The good news? Most of these issues are simple to fix once you know what to look for.</p>

    <h2>1. Domain and Hosting</h2>
    <p>Google AdSense requires a solid domain and reliable hosting. A domain with history adds trust value — applying right after buying a domain is a bad idea. Approval can take anywhere from a few months to a couple of years depending on your content quality.</p>
    <p>Free platforms like Blogger and WordPress.com have limitations: Blogger has long-standing issues with AdSense integration, and free WordPress.com doesn’t allow monetization at all. Invest in a proper domain and hosting for better chances.</p>

    <h2>2. Traffic</h2>
    <p>Even with great content and a professional website, without traffic your efforts won’t pay off. While AdSense doesn’t have a fixed traffic requirement, more visitors mean more earning potential. Promote your site on social platforms like Facebook, Pinterest, Quora, and Twitter to build consistent traffic.</p>

    <h2>3. Patience</h2>
    <p>Rejections are common. Take the feedback seriously, fix the issues, and reapply after making improvements. Good things take time, so don’t rush the process.</p>

    <h2>Drawback</h2>
    <p>Some free custom domains can get approved for AdSense, but it’s not guaranteed. These require extra work, and patience is key. Don’t expect instant results.</p>

    <h2>Simple Advice</h2>
    <p>Even if your site gets approved, remember to factor in the cost of your domain, hosting, and website maintenance. Ad blockers reduce ad revenue, and most ads pay very little per click — sometimes just $0.01. Rarely, you might get high-paying clicks worth $2, but that depends on luck and your audience.</p>
    <p>Revenue depends on unique visitors, not bots — fake traffic can get you banned. Large websites can earn six figures per month, but for beginners, grow steadily. Avoid buying courses that promise instant approval; many use bot traffic, which will get you banned.</p>
