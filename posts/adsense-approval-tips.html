    <p>So all you have thought of getting some extra bucks but ended up discouraged because of AdSense emails.</p>

    <p>Yep, the same issue many bloggers are facing nowadays. But the reason is very simple, which they ignore, and the real reason matters. So let's get going and discuss these simple issues which have become a headache for many bloggers.</p>

    <h2>1. Domain and Hosting</h2>
    <p>Google AdSense requires a solid domain and hosting with a good domain life that gives them trust value. In short, it doesn’t mean you buy a domain today and tomorrow you apply for AdSense — that’s wrong. Patience is everything. It may take you 2 years or 5 months for approval depending on your content. If you use a custom built-in domain website like Blogger or free WordPress, they don’t get monetized because Blogger has one unresolved issue and free WordPress doesn’t let you monetize. I have tried for 1 year on all these so don’t waste your time.</p>

    <h2>2. Traffic</h2>
    <p>Even if you have a good website and good content, without traffic all your hard work is useless. AdSense doesn’t require any specific visit number but traffic is needed for earning. The easy way is to share your site on social media platforms like Facebook, Pinterest, Quora, and Twitter — they are popular for gaining views.</p>

    <h2>3. Patience</h2>
    <p>You may receive rejections from AdSense but stay patient and fix the problems. Everything takes time, so wait and give it the time it needs.</p>

    <h2>Drawback</h2>
    <p>I know many of you want to create a website but don’t have money. AdSense doesn’t require a specific domain — shock, right? Many sites offer a built-in custom domain which needs some hard work but can be ready for AdSense without spending a dime. Remember, results are not 100% guaranteed. Patience is key. Things are hard, but they will work in your favor.</p>

    <h2>Simple Advice</h2>
    <p>Even if your website is approved by AdSense, there are many things to consider like revenue, cost of domain and hosting, and cost of running and maintaining your site. Calculate them first if you are thinking about AdSense as a full-time job. Nowadays, many people use ad blockers to skip ads — and many are free. They decrease your revenue. Some ads pay as low as $0.001 per click, but sometimes you may get an ad paying $2 for a click — it depends on your luck and visitors.</p>
    <p>Revenue depends on unique visitors, not bots. Bots give you views but AdSense doesn’t count them and you may get banned. If you have 20,000 daily views, you can sit back and try to gain more. If views are low, you may not earn enough to meet daily needs. I’m not saying websites can’t earn large amounts — many earn $100,000 a month from AdSense — but if you’re new, take small steps. Greed can take you nowhere.</p>
    <p>A final tip: Don’t buy courses or material that promise to boost AdSense earnings. They usually use bots, AdSense will catch you immediately, and you’ll be banned. Be safe and stay safe.</p>
