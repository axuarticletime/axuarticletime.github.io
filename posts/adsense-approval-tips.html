    <p style="margin-top:12px">Many bloggers struggle to get AdSense approval, but the reason is often simpler than they think. Here are the most common issues and how to fix them.</p>

    <h3>1. Domain and Hosting</h3>
    <p>Google AdSense prefers a solid domain with some age. That doesnâ€™t mean you need to wait years, but applying the day after buying your domain is rarely a good idea. It can take anywhere from a few months to two years, depending on your content quality.</p>
    <p>If you are using free platforms like Blogger or WordPress.com, note that they often have limitations on monetization. A custom domain with reliable hosting usually increases your chances.</p>

    </div>

    <h3>2. Traffic</h3>
    <p>Even with a great site and strong content, you still need real visitors. While AdSense doesnâ€™t list a minimum traffic requirement, more visitors means better earning potential. Share your content on social media platforms like Facebook, Pinterest, Quora, and Twitter to gain organic views.</p>

    <h3>3. Patience</h3>
    <p>Rejections happen. Donâ€™t get discouraged â€” fix the issues mentioned in the feedback and reapply after making improvements.</p>

    <h3>Drawback</h3>
    <p>Even if your site gets approved, there are financial factors to consider: domain and hosting costs, site maintenance, and the impact of ad blockers on your revenue. Many ads pay very little per click (sometimes as low as $0.01), while higher-paying ads depend on luck and the right audience.</p>
    <p>AdSense earnings are based on unique visitors â€” bot traffic not only doesnâ€™t count, but can also get your account banned. If you have a consistent 20,000 daily visitors, you can earn a decent income. However, if youâ€™re just starting out, grow steadily and avoid shortcuts.</p>
    <p>Do not buy courses or traffic packages that promise fast results â€” they often use bots, which can lead to an immediate ban. Be patient, work honestly, and build your siteâ€™s value over time.</p>
