    <p style="margin-top:12px">So all you have thought of getting some extra bucks, but ended up discouraged because of AdSense rejection emails.</p>

    <p>Yep, the same issue many bloggers are facing nowadays. But the reason is very simple ‚Äî they ignore the real cause. Let‚Äôs discuss these simple issues which have become a headache for many bloggers.</p>

    <h3>1. Domain and Hosting</h3>
    <p>Google AdSense requires a solid domain and hosting with good domain age that gives them trust value. It doesn‚Äôt mean you buy a domain today and apply tomorrow ‚Äî that‚Äôs wrong. Patience is everything. It may take you 2 years or 5 months for approval depending on your content.</p>
    <p>If you use a custom built-in domain website like Blogger or free WordPress, they don‚Äôt get monetized because Blogger has issues that are unresolvable, and free WordPress doesn‚Äôt let you monetize. I‚Äôve tried for 1 year on all these, so don‚Äôt waste your time.</p>

    <h3>2. Traffic</h3>
    <p>Even if you have a good website and content, without traffic all hard work is of no use. AdSense doesn‚Äôt require a specific number of visits, but traffic is essential for earnings. Share your content on social media like Facebook, Pinterest, Quora, and Twitter ‚Äî they are great for gaining views.</p>

    <h3>3. Patience</h3>
    <p>You may receive rejections from AdSense, but stay patient and fix the problems. Approval takes time, so wait and keep improving.</p>

    <h3>Drawback</h3>
    <p>Many of you want to create a website but don‚Äôt have money. AdSense doesn‚Äôt require a paid domain ‚Äî shocking, right? Many sites offer built-in custom domains that, with hard work, can be approved without spending a dime. But remember, nothing is 100% guaranteed. Be patient and persistent ‚Äî things are hard, but they will work in your favor.</p>

    <h3>Simple Advice</h3>
    <p>Even if your website is approved by AdSense, consider costs like domain, hosting, and maintenance before relying on it as a full-time job. Many users now use ad blockers, reducing revenue. Some ads pay very little (e.g., $0.001 per click), while others may pay $2 per click depending on your luck and visitors.</p>
    <p>Revenue also depends on unique visitors, not bots ‚Äî using bots can get you banned. If you have high daily views (e.g., 20,000), you can aim for bigger earnings. If not, you might not meet your daily needs. Some websites earn over $100,000/month from AdSense, but if you‚Äôre new, take small steps. Avoid buying courses or ‚Äúmagic‚Äù tools, as many use bots that will get you banned. Be safe and stay safe.</p>
