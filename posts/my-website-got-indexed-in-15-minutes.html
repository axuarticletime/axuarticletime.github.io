    <p>I still can’t believe it — my GitHub Pages website got indexed by Google in just 15 minutes! And believe it or not, it only took me four hours to build the entire site on my own, even without a lot of coding skills.</p>

    <p>This was a huge shock for me because before this, I had spent three frustrating years trying to fix indexing issues on my Blogger site. No matter what I did — changing themes (45 times!), editing robots.txt, or setting up redirects — Google kept showing a redirect error because of Blogger’s built-in m=1 mobile URL issue that most new users don’t even know about.</p>

    <p>Now with GitHub Pages? No errors, no headaches — just instant indexing.</p>

    <h2>Blogger m=1 Issue (Built-In Problem)</h2>
    <p>If you’ve used Blogger, you’ve probably heard of the m=1 redirect problem. Here’s the truth: it’s not a theme issue. It’s not a settings issue. It’s a core Blogger problem with no real fix.</p>

    <p>Google uses two bots to index websites — one desktop bot and one mobile bot. The mobile bot visits a Blogger site and sees two URLs: example.blogspot.com (desktop) and example.blogspot.com/?m=1 (mobile). Even though both show the same content, Google treats them as separate pages and flags it as duplicate content. It also sees a redirect, which looks suspicious to Google’s algorithm.</p>

    <p>I tried everything — custom domains, robots.txt edits, canonical tags — but nothing worked. Blogger’s system is just broken for SEO in 2025.</p>

    <h2>WordPress — Free vs Paid</h2>
    <p>Since Blogger failed me, I looked into WordPress. Half of the internet uses WordPress — which sounds amazing, but there are two versions you should understand.</p>

    <p><strong>WordPress.com (Free Version) — Not Worth It</strong><br>
    ❌ No AdSense approval, free sites are not eligible.<br>
    ❌ Limited themes and plugins.<br>
    ❌ No true custom domain unless you pay.</p>

    <p><strong>WordPress.org (Self-Hosted) — Better, But Costs Money</strong><br>
    ✅ AdSense is possible if your content is original.<br>
    ✅ Unlimited plugins and themes with a paid domain.<br>
    ❌ Requires hosting and a domain to even start.<br>
    ❌ Without traffic, even a great site won't earn anything.</p>

    <p>The biggest issue? You need traffic to make money. If nobody visits, even the best WordPress site won’t earn a penny.</p>

    <h2>Why GitHub Worked for Me</h2>
    <p>After wasting years on Blogger and researching WordPress, I tried GitHub Pages — and honestly, it was a game changer.</p>

    <p><strong>Pros of GitHub Pages:</strong><br>
    ✔ Blazing-fast indexing (15 minutes in my case!)<br>
    ✔ No hosting costs (completely free)<br>
    ✔ Full control over code (ChatGPT can help you fix problems)<br>
    ✔ No m=1 redirect issues</p>

    <p><strong>Drawbacks of GitHub Pages:</strong><br>
    ❌ Requires basic coding knowledge (HTML, CSS, Markdown)<br>
    ❌ No built-in CMS — you write everything in code<br>
    ❌ No plugins — you must add features manually through code</p>

    <p>But here’s the thing: if you can follow tutorials and use ChatGPT for small fixes, you can build a professional site easily.</p>

    <h2>Can You Really Monetize GitHub Pages with AdSense?</h2>
    <p>This is my biggest question: Will AdSense approve a GitHub Pages site? I posted this in the Google AdSense Community and learned that AdSense does not care if you have a custom domain or not — they look at content quality and originality. You earn from impressions left by real visitors, not from bots or page hits.</p>

    <p>I’m not saying GitHub will get monetized 100%, because I am still testing it myself. I even read one blog where someone said he got AdSense approval on a built-in GitHub domain, but another person on Quora said it’s not possible. So I thought, why not test it myself?</p>

    <p>Right now, if you are reading this, that means I have completed step one — getting indexed. Step two is building more pages, and step three is AdSense approval. Let's see what happens. I don’t guarantee that if I get approved, you will too. I’m just trying to confirm if GitHub Pages can actually be monetized.</p>

    <p>So keep in mind: don’t rush for success — it will come slowly. In the past three years I was tired of Blogger, I lost hope, but then I thought: “If I don’t do it for myself, who will?” That idea gave me the strength to start again. It will take time, but don’t ignore your studies or health. Sitting on a laptop all day will harm your eyes and your body. First take care of yourself, then work hard with balance.</p>

    <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Blogger’s m=1 issue is unsolvable and blocks proper indexing.</li>
      <li>Free WordPress cannot be monetized and is very limited.</li>
      <li>GitHub sites require learning but get indexed very fast.</li>
      <li>Use original content — don’t rely only on AI.</li>
      <li>Switching platforms sometimes saves years of frustration.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
    <p><strong>Blogger’s m=1 issue?</strong> No real fix — switch platforms.</p>
    <p><strong>WordPress free?</strong> Too restrictive for AdSense.</p>
    <p><strong>GitHub Pages?</strong> Best for fast indexing & full control.</p>
