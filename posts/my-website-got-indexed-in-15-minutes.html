    <p>I created a website on GitHub — and you know what, my site got indexed by Google in just 15 minutes! It took me only four hours to create that website. To be honest, I thought I would get another red line saying “redirect issue,” just like on my Blogger website.</p>

    <p>I worked on my Blogger site for about three years. I watched all YouTube videos, even used ChatGPT to solve the problem. But in the end, all my time was wasted and the stress it gave me was too much. I thought maybe it was the theme problem — I changed 45 themes but the issue was still there. Then I used robots.txt, then custom redirects — still the redirect error. I was tired of this nonsense. I got angry, talking to myself, thinking and thinking how to solve the problem. But the answer was simple — it can’t be solved no matter how hard you try because it has one problem: the m=1 issue. A simple problem but with no real solution.</p>

    <h2>Blogger m=1 Issue (Built-In Problem)</h2>
    <p>Today the Blogger platform has a big issue called m=1. This issue is not caused by theme or settings — it is built into Blogger. Let me explain: Google uses bots to index your site — one desktop bot and one mobile bot. They check if your website is mobile-friendly and desktop-friendly. They check redirects, because many websites use redirects to send users to other sites. You may have experienced this — clicking something and immediately being redirected elsewhere, which is frustrating.</p>
    <p>To protect users, Google scans these things. If your site is clean, it can be indexed in just 10 minutes. You may not believe it, but my GitHub website (without even a custom domain) was indexed in just 10 minutes — the site you are reading now. It was built in just a few hours. So I understood the m=1 Blogger issue and why Google shows redirect error.</p>

    <h2>WordPress — Free vs Paid</h2>
    <p>Half of the internet uses WordPress — shocking, right? It is easy to use and many hosting platforms like Hostinger or GoDaddy offer built-in WordPress setup. It also has many extensions for SEO ranking and boosting engagement. But remember: there is no free lunch.</p>
    <p>WordPress has two versions: WordPress.org and WordPress.com (free). The free WordPress gives limited extensions, no pro themes, and you cannot monetize it with AdSense — not an option. WordPress.org (paid) has unlimited extensions and good themes and you can monetize with AdSense — but you must spend money on domain and hosting. If there is no traffic, then there is no use. You will not earn even 0.1 cent if no one visits. If your content is strong, you might attract attention. Also, Google AdSense says you can use AI content, but if you just copy and paste and change a few lines, it will be considered low-quality content. Because many people use the same ChatGPT content and do the same edits. So use your own original content — not like others.</p>

    <h2>Why GitHub Worked for Me</h2>
    <p>On GitHub, you may need some knowledge of programming or at least keep your brain active — a single mistake can ruin your whole website. It took me three days to find a small issue in my image name which was saved with .png.png — even using ChatGPT! So yes, GitHub can be easy and hard. But if you have good observation and use ChatGPT plus your brain, you can create a great website. My site got indexed in 15 minutes. So if you like what I write, follow my website — following is important!</p>

    <!-- INSERTED PARAGRAPH  -->
    <p>So you might be thinking in your mind which platform to choose, right? Honestly, I can't even say it clearly because the truth will only be known after I apply for AdSense. Then I can finally tell whether a GitHub website can really be monetized or not. I asked this same question to three top AI tools: ChatGPT said yes, it can be monetized if the content is real. DeepSeek said no, because Google AdSense doesn’t work for custom built-in domains. Grok said if the site root is accessible and indexed, then you only need to write 19 original articles. And even Google says GitHub doesn’t allow commercial ads by default, but with proper code you can do it. So all these answers confused me. I even read one blog where a man said he got AdSense approval on a built-in domain, but another person on Quora said it's not possible. So I thought, why not test it myself? Right now, if you are reading this, that means I have completed step one — getting indexed. Step two is building more pages, and step three is AdSense approval. Let's see what happens. But I advise you, don't take this as a full-time job. I don’t guarantee that if I get approved, you will too. I am just trying to confirm if GitHub Pages can be monetized. Also, I am not telling you to spend money. If you like my experience, follow my website because following is important.</p>

    <p>So keep in mind: don’t rush for success — it will come slowly. In the past three years I was tired of Blogger, I lost hope, but a thought came into my head: “If I don’t do it for myself, who will?” That thinking made me start again. It will take time, but it doesn’t mean you should spend all your time on it and ignore your studies. Sitting on a laptop all day is not healthy — first take care of your health, then do your work, but don’t get too addicted. Otherwise your eyesight will get weak.

    <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Blogger’s m=1 issue is unsolvable and blocks proper indexing.</li>
      <li>Free WordPress cannot be monetized and is very limited.</li>
      <li>GitHub sites require learning but get indexed very fast.</li>
      <li>Use original content — don’t rely only on AI.</li>
      <li>Switching platforms sometimes saves years of frustration.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
    <p><strong>Blogger’s m=1 issue?</strong> No real fix — switch platforms.</p>
    <p><strong>WordPress free?</strong> Too restrictive for AdSense.</p>
    <p><strong>GitHub Pages?</strong> Best for fast indexing & full control.</p>
